# FPS - Maze Generator
## Introduction
* My first game with Unity, made during the course "Modern Video Games" at McGill University.
* Each session of the game generates a complete maze using [Wilson's Algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/20/maze-generation-wilson-s-algorithm "Wilson Algorithm")
* Use arrow key to move and space bar to shoot.
